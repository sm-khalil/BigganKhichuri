## About Vext and the AI Chatbot

The chatbot in this project uses Vext, a platform for building and fine-tuning AI chatbots based on GPT models.

Vext allows users to create custom AI assistants by fine-tuning pre-trained GPT models with their own data. In this project, the chatbot sends user messages to a Vext hook endpoint. Vext processes the input using a fine-tuned GPT model and returns a response.

To set up the chatbot:
- Sign up on Vext website.
- Create a project and fine-tune a GPT model with your training data (conversations, FAQs, etc.).
- Get the hook URL and API key from Vext.
- Configure the environment variables in the Flask app.

The fine-tuning process involves:
1. Collecting training data relevant to your chatbot's purpose.
2. Uploading the data to Vext.
3. Training the model on Vext's platform.
4. Deploying the model to get a hook URL for API calls.

This way, the chatbot can provide more accurate and context-specific responses compared to a generic GPT model.
